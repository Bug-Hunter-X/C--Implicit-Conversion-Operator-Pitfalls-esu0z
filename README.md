# C# Implicit Conversion Operator Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates a potential pitfall when using implicit conversion operators in C#. Implicit conversions, while convenient, can sometimes make code less readable and introduce subtle bugs if not carefully considered.  The example shows how seemingly straightforward implicit conversions can lead to unexpected behavior when combined with arithmetic operations.

## Bug Description

The `MyClass` class defines implicit conversion operators to and from `int`. While this allows for fluent code, it can mask the underlying type conversions and make debugging more difficult. The issue becomes more apparent when combining implicit conversions with arithmetic operations, as the type conversions happen implicitly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and making it harder to track down the cause of errors.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to use explicit conversion to make the code more readable and maintainable, which will reduce the risk of unexpected behavior due to implicit conversions.  Explicit conversion emphasizes the conversion process, improving code clarity and maintainability, and making debugging easier.
